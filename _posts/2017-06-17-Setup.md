This is the CCS811 Air Quality Sensor.

As mentioned in a previous post, my job is to write a driver for this sensor, using the IIO interface. The sensor comes on a breakout board, as you can see in the picture. This allows us to use it as an I2C device, but I still need a way to connect it to my system. For this reason, I've received an Udoo **NEO**:

Just kidding, this one:

The UDOO NEO is an open hardware computer that embeds 2 cores(1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A9 and ARM Cortex-M4) on the same processor(NXP i.MX 6SoloX). You can see full specs here: <https://www.udoo.org/udoo-neo/>.

Putting all the parts together:
